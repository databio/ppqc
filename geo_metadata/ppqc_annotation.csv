GM12878 were cultured as described previously (GSE39878).",total RNA,"PRO-seq libraries were prepared as described previously (Kwak et al., 2013). Briefly, 5×10^6 nuclei were added to 2 X Nuclear Run-On (NRO) reaction mixture (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM KCl, 1% Sarkosyl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.375 mM each of biotin-11-A/C/G/UTP (Perkin-Elmer), 0.8 u/µl RNase inhibitor) and incubated for 3 min at 30˚C. Nascent RNA was extracted and fragmented by base hydrolysis in 0.2 N NaOH on ice for 10~12 min, and neutralized by adding 1 X volume of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8. Fragmented nascent RNA was purified using streptavidin beads, ligated with reverse 3' RNA adapter (5'p-GAUCGUCGGACUG-UAGAACUCUGAAC-/3'InvdT/), and biotin-labeled products were enriched by another round of streptavidin bead binding and extraction. For 5' end repair, the RNA products were successively treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP, Epicentre) and polynucleotide kinase (PNK, NEB). 5' repaired RNA was ligated to reverse 5' RNA adaptor (5'-CCUUGGCACCCGAGAAUUCCA-3') before being further purified by the third round of streptavidin bead binding and extraction. RNA was reverse transcribed using 25 pmol Illumina RP1 primer (5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGA-3'). The product was amplified 15 cycles and products greater than 120 bp (insert > 70 bp) were PAGE purified before being analyzed by Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument.",This Sample represents two sequencing replicates.,Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Processed data files are bigWigs.
