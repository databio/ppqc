Nascent RNA was extracted and fragmented by base hydrolysis in 0.2 N NaOH on ice for 10~12 min, and neutralized by adding 1 X volume of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8. Fragmented nascent RNA was purified using streptavidin beads, ligated with reverse 3' RNA adapter (5'p-GAUCGUCGGACUG-UAGAACUCUGAAC-/3'InvdT/), and biotin-labeled products were enriched by another round of streptavidin bead binding and extraction. For 5' end repair, the RNA products were successively treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP, Epicentre) and polynucleotide kinase (PNK, NEB). 5' repaired RNA was ligated to reverse 5' RNA adaptor (5'-CCUUGGCACCCGAGAAUUCCA-3') before being further purified by the third round of streptavidin bead binding and extraction. RNA was reverse transcribed using 25 pmol Illumina RP1 primer (5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGA-3').

The RNA was further extracted once with acid phenol:chloroform, and once with chloroform before precipitating with 2.5 volumes of -20oC ethanol. Bead binding buffers all contained 4units/ml of SUPERaseIN (Ambion) and the following buffers were slightly modified.
